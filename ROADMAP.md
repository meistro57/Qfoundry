## 2. `ROADMAP.md`
This is the strategic vision. It shows that while the seed is powerful, the forest is still growing.


# 🗺 Qfoundry Strategic Roadmap

The path from a single script to a self-evolving intelligence.

## 📍 Phase I: Ignition (Current)
- [x] Recursive Bash Forge (The `forge.sh` script)
- [x] Multi-stack selection (TALL vs Nuxt UI)
- [x] Integration of "The 18 Skills" (Prism, Maduro, Neuron, etc.)
- [x] Sudo-aware dependency resolution

## 🧠 Phase II: The Neural Link (Coming Next)
- [ ] **Unified Agent Factory:** A single command to generate specialized agents (Auditors, Architects, Narrators).
- [ ] **Blade-Prompt Library:** Pre-baked, industry-standard prompts for common AI tasks.
- [ ] **Context-Aware Memory:** Native implementation of MemRL episodic storage using SQLite.

## 🗣 Phase III: The Sensory Layer
- [ ] **Multi-Voice Orchestration:** Assigning unique cloned voices to different agent personas.
- [ ] **Visual Reasoning:** Gemini-powered video and image analysis pipelines.
- [ ] **Whisp TUI expansion:** Real-time agent monitoring over SSH.

## 💰 Phase IV: The Sovereign Economy
- [ ] **Credit-Gated Agents:** Native integration between Neuron Agents and Climactic Credits.
- [ ] **Automated Billing:** Usage-based ledger tracking for AI tasks.

## 🌌 Phase V: Transcendence
- [ ] **Self-Optimizing Code:** Agents that use Rector to refactor themselves based on performance logs.
- [ ] **Qfoundry Cloud:** Instant deployment of the Forge to specialized AI-optimized servers.


*Follow the forge. The empire is only one `bash` command away.*
